# Blobbys-Adventure

<em>This is my version of the 'Project Boost' game from gamedev.tv 3D Unity Course. The game is created within the Unity engine, using C# </em>

## Goal
Help guide Blobby to his destination pad to advance through the levels. Avoid colliding with anything elseâ€¦ including the ground, the ceiling and the sides. Around 10 levels in this prototype.

## Controls
Space = Boost (and start game)
A + D = Rotate Blobby left/right
Q = Quit
